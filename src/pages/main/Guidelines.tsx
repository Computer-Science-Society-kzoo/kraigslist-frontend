        This includes, but is not limited to, posting his bad jokes (Aleksandr: can we change this to "posting his jokes without his permission" i've never heard of bad jokes from Dr. Vargas-Perez), personal attacks on using Sublime, or any other content that could be considered disrespectful. Kraigslist believes that
        maintaining a respectful community is essential to the success of Kragislist, and we thank you for your cooperation.
